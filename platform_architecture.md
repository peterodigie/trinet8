## Data Flow

### User Registration and Authentication Flow

1. User registers through web/mobile app
2. Application validates input and encrypts sensitive data
3. User data is stored in the User Data Store
4. Authentication token is generated and returned to client
5. Subsequent requests include the token for validation

### Therapy Session Flow

1. User schedules a session with a therapist
2. Notification is sent to both user and therapist
3. At scheduled time, secure video connection is established
4. Session notes are encrypted and stored in Clinical Data Store
5. AI analyzes session content for sentiment and key themes (with consent)
6. Post-session recommendations are generated based on analysis

### AI Interaction Flow

1. User initiates conversation with AI therapeutic tool
2. Input is processed by NLP services for intent and sentiment
3. Appropriate AI module responds based on user need
4. Interaction is monitored for escalation triggers
5. If escalation threshold is reached, human therapist is alerted
6. Interaction data is anonymized and stored for model improvement

### Data Backup and Recovery Flow

1. Automated daily backups of all databases
2. Encrypted backup files stored in secure cloud storage
3. Retention policies applied based on data type
4. Regular recovery testing to ensure data integrity
5. Audit logs maintained for all backup and recovery operations

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user types
- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for authentication
- Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
