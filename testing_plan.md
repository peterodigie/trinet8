## Feedback Collection Mechanisms

### In-App Feedback

1. **Post-Session Surveys**
   - Rating scale (1-5) for session quality
   - Rating for AI helpfulness
   - Open-ended feedback field

2. **Feature-Specific Feedback**
   - Contextual feedback buttons throughout the interface
   - "Was this helpful?" prompts after AI interactions
   - Thumbs up/down on therapeutic suggestions

3. **Sentiment Correctness Rating**
   - "Did this response feel understanding?" after AI interactions
   - Scale for empathy perception

### User Interviews

1. **Structured Interviews**
   - 30-minute sessions with selected test users
   - Focus on overall experience and pain points
   - Specific questions about AI-human integration

2. **Usability Testing Sessions**
   - Observed task completion
   - Think-aloud protocol
   - Identify navigation and interaction issues

### Automated Metrics Collection

1. **Usage Analytics**
   - Feature engagement rates
   - Time spent on different sections
   - Completion rates for therapeutic exercises
   - Session attendance and duration

2. **Error Tracking**
   - UI/UX issues
   - API failures
   - AI misunderstandings
   - Edge case identification

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Page load times
   - API response times
   - Resource utilization

## Edge Case Testing

1. **AI Escalation Protocol**
   - Test with crisis keywords
   - Verify therapist notification
   - Measure response time

2. **Connectivity Issues**
   - Test with intermittent connections
   - Verify data preservation
   - Test offline capabilities

3. **Accessibility Edge Cases**
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - High contrast mode
   - Text scaling

4. **Security Edge Cases**
   - Multiple failed login attempts
   - Session hijacking attempts
   - Unusual access patterns
   - Data access from new devices/locations

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

1. **Bug Classification**
   - Critical: Prevents core functionality, security issues
   - High: Significantly impacts user experience
   - Medium: Affects functionality but has workarounds
   - Low: Minor issues, cosmetic problems

2. **Resolution Process**
   - Critical bugs: Immediate fix required
   - High bugs: Fix before pilot launch
   - Medium bugs: Prioritize based on impact
   - Low bugs: Address in future iterations

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Ensure fixes don't introduce new issues
